# Arkanoid
I made Arkanoid Clone with cocos2d-x framework in 3 weeks.

# Masomo Intership
This is my Masomo project. I started 3 weeks ago. I builded myself and solved the problems. I have limited time and some design choise is bad.
I love the project but I didn't contiune because I want to learn Windows library and I don't think to use cocos2d at my career. 
They say me "Build a project like Arkanoid and juice it." and has a link. link is "Jucie it or loose it" youtube video. 
I didn't add all features but added most of features. I focused C++ and OOP.

# Requirments
- Linux or Android Studio. I don't know runable other platforms.

# TLDR
- Had problems and solved it and I didn't force myself to use "Design Patterns".
- Scipted like "DI Container" and solve my problems, its enough.
- Levels hold in string and get data with level manager.
- Added juciy effects at "Jucie it or loose it" video.

# Whats Good
- DI Container fine, if you want see dependency.
- Game Feel is right.
- Level System is very good and easy to add new level.
- Game install manage everything and it's cool.

# Whats Bad
- Game manager hold vaus health data because company lead say don't use static variables (its sucks btw they are use lol).
- I dont pass the data in components.
- Components system is very bad because i dont have =D.
- Cocos2d-x is bad framework someone must say that.
